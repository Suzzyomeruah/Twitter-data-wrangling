# Twitter-data-wrangling

The dataset contains data from the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as 
WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous 
comment about the dog. 
These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always 
greater than 10. 
WeRateDogs has over a million followers and has received international media coverage

The main objective of this project is to perform analysis on the WeRateDog tweets from 2015 - 2017, which involves gathering, assessing and cleaning the dataset.

Data Gathering
Three different sources of data were used for this project

twitter_archive_enchanced.csv directly downloaded from the udacity server

tweet image prediction(image_predictions.tsv) downloaded using the request libary

tweet_json downloaded directly because twitter did not approve my developer account

Conclusion
Data analysis can provide us with valuable insights that can help us improve our performance in 
any field. 
By understanding which breeds and dog stages are most popular, which devices are used to 
tweet, at which stage of life dogs are mostly featured and words that are frequently used, we 
can create more engaging content and connect with our audience more effectively
